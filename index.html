    How People Learn
    </h1>

    <p>
The common essence of both Derek Muller and Carol Dweck’s ideologies in the learning mindset is that to learn something, or to learn more, we need to consider ourselves as an “ignorant”.

    <p>
Being “ignorant” doesn’t imply someone’s stupidity, but one’s space for absorbing new knowledge and developing oneself. That’s important for people to learn something. There is case talking about being “ignorant” by Derek in his example “asking people the question of how the trees gain mass”, and this is somewhat supported by the Dweck’s study in fixed mindset and growth mindset.

The first video is Muller asks a lot of “stupid” questions about how trees gain mass. He asks different questions, and those questions are pretty easy I would say. That’s why it is said in the second video that he makes those interviewers look stupid. Muller does that on purpose. The purpose is to show that rather than directly giving out the answer, through asking a lot easy but related questions, people can memorize the answer better, because they would have process to memorize that, instead of feeling like they know the answer after being directly told what the answer is. Dweck’s study can play a role in explaining that phenomenon. In Dweck’s case, she categorized two mindsets: fixed mindset and growth mindset. When people have a fixed mindset that they believe the intelligence or traits are fixed. Those people would be less likely put effort to develop themselves. Those with growth minder think differently, as they believe talents can be developed, so they are willing to work harder. Of course Dweck’s study cannot one hundred percent explain Muller’s example. But the key is the same, which is if people want to learn, it is better to learn with the growth mindset as it provides the space for one to develop to learn the knowledge.
